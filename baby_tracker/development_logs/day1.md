# Day 1 – Initial Setup and First Blink Test (May 19, 2025)

## Goals: 
- Set up ESP32 development environment
- Test board with a simple blink + serial output
- Push code to GitHub
## Tools:
- ESP32-WROOM-32
- PlatformIO in VS Code
- Host OS: Linux (based on /dev/ttyUSB0 and udev warning)
- Git + GitHub for version control
## Steps:
1. Installed PlatformIO extension in VS Code
2. Created a new PlatformIO project
   - Board: DOIT DEVKIT V1 variant
   - Framework: arduino
   - Project name: baby_tracker
## Verified project structure created by PlatformIO:
```
baby_tracker/
├── src/main.cpp
├── platformio.ini
├── lib/ include/ test/ .pio/ (auto-generated)
```
## Edited main.cpp with blink + serial print test:
```
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Serial.println("ESP32 Blink Test Starting...");
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  Serial.println("LED ON");
  delay(500);
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  Serial.println("LED OFF");
  delay(500);
}
```
### Faced flash error during first upload:
```
A fatal error occurred: Unable to verify flash chip connection (No serial data received.)
```
Successfully uploaded firmware again by just click Upload button again:
```
[SUCCESS] Took 6.58 seconds
```
## Opened serial monitor and confirmed output:
```
ESP32 Blink Test Starting...
LED ON
LED OFF
```
## Confirmed onboard LED is blinking

Restarted board using EN button to re-trigger serial output

## Results:
- ESP32 verified working
- Upload, serial output, and onboard LED confirmed
- Ready to move to next module (e.g. DHT sensor, buttons)

## Notes:
Selected board type esp32doit-devkit-v1 seems correct for ESP-WROOM-32 from Jingdong
